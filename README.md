# Steg
This project is a practical implementation of simple(soon to be advanced) Steganography Cryptography methods.
As this program develops, it will be made increasingly more efficient, and have more secure methods of message hiding.

## Usage Tutorial
Using this program should be fairly intuitive. There are text boxes and file/folder selectors for all input and output, so you don't have to worry about weird syntax. It's all done for you.

## Features
At the moment, the only method that this program implements is LSB Steg, or Least Significant Bit Steganography.
